## 3. Data Integration and Management Pipeline
**Objective**: Develop a robust data pipeline for integrating and managing data from multiple sources.

### Steps:
#### Requirements Gathering:
1. Identify the data sources to be integrated.
2. Determine the format and frequency of data updates.

#### Environment Setup:
1. Set up a development environment with Python, SQL, and necessary libraries (e.g., Airflow for pipeline management).

#### Data Extraction:
1. Write scripts to extract data from different sources using APIs.

#### Data Transformation:
1. Process the extracted data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. Handle missing or erroneous data.

#### Data Loading:
1. Design and set up a PostgreSQL database.
2. Load the transformed data into the database.

#### Pipeline Management:
1. Use Apache Airflow to manage and schedule the data pipeline.
2. Set up DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to define the workflow.

#### Monitoring and Alerts:
1. Implement monitoring to track the pipeline's performance.
2. Set up alerts for any pipeline failures or data inconsistencies.

#### Testing and Validation:
1. Test the pipeline with sample data.
2. Validate the integrity and accuracy of the integrated data.
