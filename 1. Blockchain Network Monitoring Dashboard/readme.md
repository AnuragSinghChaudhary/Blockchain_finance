## 1. Blockchain Network Monitoring Dashboard
**Objective**: Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor various Proof-of-Stake protocols and blockchain networks.

### Steps:
#### Requirements Gathering:
1. Identify the key metrics to monitor (e.g., staking activity, reward rates, network performance).
2. Determine the data sources (e.g., blockchain explorers, aggregators).

#### Environment Setup:
1. Set up a development environment with Python, SQL, and necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Flask/Django for web dashboard).

#### Data Collection:
1. Write scripts to fetch data from blockchain explorers and aggregators using APIs.
2. Ensure data is collected in a structured format.

#### Data Storage:
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database.
2. Design database schema to store fetched data.

#### Data Processing:
1. Write ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts to process raw data and store it in the database.

#### Dashboard Development:
1. Use a web framework like Flask or Django to create the dashboard.
2. Integrate with a front-end library (e.g., React, D3.js) for data visualization.

#### Real-Time Data Updates:
1. Implement background tasks (e.g., using Celery) to periodically update the dashboard with new data.

#### Testing and Deployment:
1. Test the dashboard with sample data.
2. Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
