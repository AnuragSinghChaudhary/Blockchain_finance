    A[Objective: Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor various Proof-of-Stake protocols and blockchain networks]

    subgraph Requirements Gathering
        RG1[Identify the key metrics to monitor (e.g., staking activity, reward rates, network performance)]
        RG2[Determine the data sources (e.g., blockchain explorers, aggregators)]
    end

    subgraph Environment Setup
        ES1[Set up a development environment with Python, SQL, and necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Flask/Django for web dashboard)]
    end

    subgraph Data Collection
        DC1[Write scripts to fetch data from blockchain explorers and aggregators using APIs]
        DC2[Ensure data is collected in a structured format]
    end

    subgraph Data Storage
        DS1[Set up a PostgreSQL database]
        DS2[Design database schema to store fetched data]
    end

    subgraph Data Processing
        DP1[Write ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts to process raw data and store it in the database]
    end

    subgraph Dashboard Development
        DD1[Use a web framework like Flask or Django to create the dashboard]
        DD2[Integrate with a front-end library (e.g., React, D3.js) for data visualization]
    end

    subgraph Real-Time Data Updates
        RT1[Implement background tasks (e.g., using Celery) to periodically update the dashboard with new data]
    end

    subgraph Testing and Deployment
        TD1[Test the dashboard with sample data]
        TD2[Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku)]
    end
